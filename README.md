# Modulation scheme classifier

This is a flask app, Demo for a Research paper [1], which employs a long
short-term memory neural network to classify modulation scheme for
Sub-Nyquist Rate Wideband Spectrum Sensing.

#### Flow diagram of the implemented application

The link of the app would be public soon!!!!
